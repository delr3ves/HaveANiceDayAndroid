Dear fellow tester, here you have some news for this version:

1. Links in texts are now clickable
2. Detail view has been improved (it's still pretty ugly but it has been improved :P)
3. Notification list has been improved (same here)
4. Now you can share the messages as text. The image sharing is not working in whatsapp right now so I disabled it.
5. You'll find a budget above the icon of the app when you have a pending notificationDAO. It only will show 1 no matter how much pending notifications you have. Increasing/decreasing this number is still in progress.

Another great new is that this version has been automatically upload to fabric once the branch is merged to master \o/.
